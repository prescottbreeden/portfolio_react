      ' is an independent seaport located in Tacoma, Washington. I was hired to extend their ability to display user experience times at each facility in real time. Their previous solution involved displaying data in iFrames being served from PowerBI, however this suffered a performance issue where updates could sometimes lag from minutes to hours. To achieve their goals, I implemented a node server running Socket.io that opens a tunnel to any connected clients and pushes updates directly every 60 seconds (no refreshing necessary). Data is cached on the server, so in the event of a blip in their distributed data, the server can fall back to the last successful query until a new query is successful. To provide additional resiliance, only one successful query (application-wide) is necessary to update all connected users.',

This project was a ground-up rebuild of their previous 20 year old system and grew to nearly than 250k lines of code. I designed and implemented the majority of the front-end architecture including: the component library, the validation library (which is now open source), the navigation, the trays and side navs, the accessibility controls, and utilities. I also established our practices around SASS, Redux, and unit-testing. In the API, I primarily helped build and extend the reporting feature as well as generate scripts to remove redundancy during implementations and improve consistency across hundreds of files. I feel thankful for the opportunity to build such an important application for thousands of educators.',

There simply was no decent composable validation solution that would allow for easy unit testing as well as re-use outside the context of forms (such as during application submission pages). Currently the library has implementations for the validations in VanillaJS for Node applications and in React as a React Hook.',

While somehwat of an impractical personal project, Lisp has probably taught me more about programming than any other language and continues to find new lessons to teach me every time I pick it back up. Other projects in Lisp I have played around with include static websites, an HTML generation library, a SPAM filter, a unit-testing framework, a portable shell, and some really silly old-school text adventure games.',

      " is a card game for 1-6 players. Users can play with their friends, the AI computer, or even just watch the computer play against itself (a la War Games). This project started as a collaborative project when I was a student at Coding Dojo. Initially it was two servers, a C# with Razor web application that was fed playing cards from an API on a seperate express server. Ironically, the choice for a second server was due to a time constraint to get the project to production after hitting a bug in Razor not consistently updated card information after JavaScript updated the DOM. Years later, I revisted this project to use it as a plaground for an idea I had for a client application. The Elm front-end communicates to an F# data access layer to have a rich Domain Driven Design and act as the hub for various microservices: user data, card data, and game logic. This is an ongoing personal project that has taught me many lessons and hardships of disperate tech stacks and microservices, however it's quite fun to hack at.",

      ' is a web app that challenges users on trivia questions scraped from the web using Python. The app offered data visualization for players to see how they stacked up across 10 different categories from kung fu to history. This project was created during my first hackathon. The biggest challenge was in generating triva questions by simply scouring wiki pages from various sources and then doing a search and replace to swap out the names (i.e. answers) with blank underscores. So if I was scraping a page that had .../michaeljackson/... in the url, it would search for text that included one instance of the name and then replace it with underscores. My focus was on the web-scraper and Django app and my parter focused on the data visualization. I later went back and used the project to apply some of the skills I learned with Sass to give it a much needed makeover.',
